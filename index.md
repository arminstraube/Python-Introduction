This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for participants with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses examples that are relevant to a wide range of use cases,
and is designed to be used as a prerequisite lesson for other Python based lessons.

This lesson references the Spyder IDE,
but can be followed with a regular Python interpreter as well. Please note that this lesson uses Python 3.
